# Digital Art Keywords
This was a group data science research project done with *COGS 108: Data Science in Practice*. This project was completed in several points, and the finalized project–with all the parts–can be found in `FinalProject_group3.ipynb`. 

## Abstract 
Using DeviantArt API tools, the project examines how certain keywords in content captions correlate with the popularity and visibility of artwork to answer the question, "Do certain keywords as identified by CLIP correlate with the popularity (as measured by the equivalent of 'likes') that artwork receives on social media?" It also looks at the relationship between viewership, likes/favorites, comments, and "Author Watchers" to see how they may–or may not–affect the popularity of DeviantArt content with the captions. Several models, such as Decisions Trees, OLS, Lassos, and Linear Regressions, further examine the significance of caption keywords and their influence in popularity.
